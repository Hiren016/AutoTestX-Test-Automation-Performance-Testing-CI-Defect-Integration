# 🤖 AutoTestX — Test Automation, Performance Testing & CI Defect Integration

**Technologies / Tools:**  
Katalon Studio, Selenium WebDriver, Apache JMeter, Jira, Automation Testing, Performance Testing, Test Reporting, CI Integration

---

## 📝 Project Description

**AutoTestX** is a comprehensive **test automation and performance testing framework** developed for the **Code Collab** web application. The project demonstrates advanced QA capabilities including **white-box testing with control flow analysis**, large-scale **automated test execution**, **continuous defect integration with Jira**, and **in-depth performance evaluation** using Apache JMeter.

The framework reduced **manual testing effort by 60%**, significantly improved test coverage and reliability, and enhanced stakeholder visibility through **automated reporting and CI-ready workflows**.

## ❓ Problem Statement

Traditional manual testing faces critical challenges in modern Agile environments:

- ⏰ **Time-intensive regression testing** — Repetitive execution consumes QA bandwidth  
- 🔄 **Inconsistent test execution** — Human error reduces reliability  
- 🐛 **Delayed defect communication** — Manual defect logging slows resolution  
- 📊 **Limited code coverage visibility** — Black-box testing misses internal flaws  
- 📈 **No performance insights** — Lack of scalability and stress analysis  

**AutoTestX addresses these challenges** through intelligent automation, white-box validation, performance testing, and seamless tool integration.
