# 🤖 AutoTestX — Automated Quality Assurance & Performance Engineering Framework

**Technologies / Tools:**  
Katalon Studio, Selenium WebDriver, Apache JMeter, Jira, Groovy, Automation Testing, Performance Testing, CI/CD Integration

---

## 📝 Project Overview

**AutoTestX** is an end-to-end **automation-driven quality assurance and performance testing framework** developed for the **Code Collab** web application. The project integrates **functional automation, white-box testing, performance engineering, and automated defect tracking** into a single unified QA workflow.

The framework significantly reduces manual testing effort, improves regression reliability, enables early defect detection, and provides actionable performance insights through automated reporting and Jira integration.

## ❓ Problem Statement

Modern Agile applications face the following QA challenges:

- ⏰ Manual regression testing is time-consuming and error-prone  
- 🔄 Inconsistent test execution affects result reliability  
- 🐛 Delayed defect reporting slows down resolution cycles  
- 📊 Limited visibility into internal code quality  
- 📈 Lack of performance metrics impacts scalability planning  

**AutoTestX addresses these gaps** by introducing automation-first testing, white-box analysis, real-time defect logging, and performance validation.

## 🛠️ Testing Scope & Capabilities

### 🔹 Automation Testing
- Automated **functional and regression testing** using Katalon Studio  
- Cross-browser validation (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)  
- Data-driven testing using external datasets  
- REST API testing for backend validation  

### 🔹 White-Box Testing
- Control Flow Graph (CFG) creation for critical modules  
- Cyclomatic Complexity analysis using `V(G) = E - N + 2`  
- Statement, branch, and path coverage validation  
- Identification of logic flaws and unreachable code  

### 🔹 Performance Testing
- Load, stress, spike, and endurance testing using Apache JMeter  
- Response time, throughput, error rate, and resource monitoring  
- Bottleneck identification and optimization recommendations  

### 🔹 Defect Management & CI Integration
- Automated defect creation in Jira on test failures  
- Attachment of logs, screenshots, and reproduction steps  
- Bi-directional sync between test execution and Jira dashboards  
- CI-triggered test execution and reporting
